## How YOU can help...

Things you have to know:

- The app is mostly written in Kotlin (but it's very similar to Java). Check out [kotlinlang.org](http://kotlinlang.org/).
- When you want to build the app, you should use Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA with the Kotlin plugin installed
- The API keys, used buy the Play Store version are removed from this code, enter your own under `mobile/src/main/java/jlelse/newscatchr/backend/apis/ApiKeys.kt`

Some things you can help with:

- Translate the app into your language [here](http://translate.jlelse.eu)
- Fix bugs, described on the [issue reporter](https://github.com/jlelse/NewsCatchr-OpenSource/issues)
- Report bugs on the [issue reporter](https://github.com/jlelse/NewsCatchr-OpenSource/issues)
- And everything else, that comes into your mind
